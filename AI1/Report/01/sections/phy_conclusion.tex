\subsection{Conclusion}
The robot was designed using three Lego Mindstorm light sensors and two motors.
One of the sensors is used for line detection when reversing and the two others for line following.

A tool was devised to capture the can when driving against it such that the robot would not need to implement a can detection.
Light protection was added to the robot in form of shielding to make it invariant to the ambient lighting conditions.

Finally the system was tested and it was found to work sufficiently enough in order to be able to complete the sokoban challenge given its solution.
