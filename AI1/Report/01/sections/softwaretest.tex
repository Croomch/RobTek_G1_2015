The sokoban solver was implemented as an A* algorithm in C++ with focus on memory consumption and processing time.
In order to test quantify the final program then this is tested in regards of these factors.

The program was written for single core processing only and executed on a Intel Core i7-3610QM running at 2.3GHz with a total of 8GB RAM running Ubuntu.

\subsection{System Test}
The program was first tested on the handed out test map from the competition of year 2014.
This was used to see if the solution found was as short as path supplied and to consider the memory consumption and processing time of the program.

The path found by the program was, like the solution provided, 124 steps indicating that the solver is capable of returning the right result.
The memory used by the program is seen in figure ...
