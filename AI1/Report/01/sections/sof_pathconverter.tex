\subsection{Path Converter}
Once a path to the sokoban problem is found, it must be translated into something understandable by the robot.
Hence a in between layer was created to make this conversation.

This takes a path and converts it from north, south, east and west to forward, backward, left and right.
Where the robot is executing its steps relative to the direction it is currently facing.

This conversion is made taken into account the direction the robot is facing.
Furthermore the robot has to push the diamonds on the map completely to the next position and then back away to its own square when the last of a sequence pushes is completed.
