After building the robot and testing all the implemented behaviours, it was found that the proposed solution is robust enough to execute any given path.
The robot works under different ambient light levels due to a mounted shield that shadows the sensors, making them less sensitive to external light.
The robot can run for over 30 minutes without problems from having a low battery level.

To find a solution for the Sokoban problem an A* algorithm has been devised.
Using the diamond pushes as nodes and the number of steps of the robot to achieve a certain state as the cost.
The algorithm uses, as heuristics, the cost of moving each diamond from their position to the nearest goal when having to push them around the walls in a else completely empty map.
The nodes in the graph are validated using the diamonds and robots state.
The individual states are checked for deadlock situations to reduce the graph.

The solver can work for any map satisfying a constrained map size.

To load the generated path into the robot, a path converter was implemented.
This function can convert the generated path to be executable for the robot.

By combining the two parts of this project, it is possible to load a certain sokoban map, find a solution for it and solve physically the challenge with the robot.
