\subsection{Node Validation}
When the graph is constructed a massive amount of nodes in the possible direction towards the goal are added to the graph.
This does however also require care in order to validate the nodes before they are added to the closed list in order to prevent excessive memory and time consumption.

Each node is hence tested in order to prevent duplicates from taking up memory and processing time.
In order to reduce the check uptime when validating a specific state, it was chosen to use a hash-table to validate if a node is present in the closed-set.
For this to work a hashing value for each node is generated.
This is done using the coordinates of the diamonds and the robot at each state.
The positions are hence combined into a string where the sorted diamonds position is added to the string first and then followed by the position of the robot.
This is then used as the unique key in the hashing table preventing state duplicates in the graph.

When solving the Sokoban problem furthermore a check for validity of the state is performed.
This is done by considering if any of the diamonds has gone into a deadlock.
Since there are many different deadlock situations, it was chosen only to implement the most simple deadlock arising when pushing a diamond into dead square deadlocks.
This prevents some of the paths explored being invalid because once gone into a deadlock the goal state is not obtainable from the new state.
Furthermore a deadlock detection is able to reduce the graph and hence improve the time taken to find the solution on maps where many deadlocks can be entered.

Since only dead square deadlock situations are considered, then these can be computed pre running the path finding.
This is then stored as on a separate map for lookup during runtime.
The dead squares found are the squares that are corners and stretches along a wall from which the diamond can not be brought to a goal.
The result of the algorithm is seen on figure \ref{fig:deadlocks}, where figure \ref{fig:orig_deadlock} is the actual map and figure \ref{fig:orig_deadlock} is the map where all deadlock situations are set to walls to indicate the dead square.
