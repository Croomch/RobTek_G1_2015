In order for the robot to solve the sokoban problem, an algorithm capable of solving the problem of sokoban is required.
This algorithm is made in C++ and made to run on a computer offline.
The route the robot then has to take is afterwards downloaded to the robot for execution.

The software implementation takes basis in the A* algorithm.
For this to work, a graph structure is created as explained first. 
Thereafter a heuristic is found and how the nodes are validated in the design such that the program does not create loops.
Finally how the solution is converted into a set of commands for the robot to execute is explained.
