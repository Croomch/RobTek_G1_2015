In order for the sokoban robot to solve the sokoban problem, an algorithm capable of solving the problem of sokoban is required.
This algorithm is made in C++ and made to run on a computer offline.
The route the robot then has to take is afterwards downloaded to the robot for execution.

The software implementation takes basis in the A* algorithm.
For this to work, a graph structure is created and this is explained first in this section. 
After which the heuristics calculation used is considered and how the nodes are validated in the design such that the program does not create loops.
Finally how the computer generates a string of characters for the robot to understand is explained.
Such that the robot is capable of following the route found by the solver.
