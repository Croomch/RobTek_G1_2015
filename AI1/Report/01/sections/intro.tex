\section{Introduction}

In this project, the problem of solving automatically the sokoban game has been faced.
To do this, the project has been divided in two different parts, being studied separately.
These are finding the shortest solution given a sokoban map and the hardware implementation of a robot able to execute the generated path.

The system loads a map and finds a solution offline with a solver. 
The output of this program is a path that the robot should follow. 
This path is loaded onto the robot, which is prepared to execute it on the sokoban map.

The robot designed is made using different LEGO and LEGO Mindstorms parts and an NXT as controller.
And the solver is programmed using C++.

%The solver is based in the A* algorithm and implemented in C++.
