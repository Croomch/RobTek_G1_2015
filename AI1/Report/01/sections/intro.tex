\section{Introduction}

In this project, the problem of solving automatically the sokoban game has been faced.
To do this, the project has been divided in two diferent parts, being studied separately the solution finding given a map and the hardware implementation of a robot able to execute the generated path.

The system loads a map and finds a solution offline with a solver. 
The output of this program is a path that the robot should follow. 
This path is loaded in the robot, which is prepared to execute it on the sokoban map.

The robot has been built using different LEGO parts and devices as an NXT module and compatible motors and sensors.

The solver has been based in the A* algorithm and implemented in C++.
