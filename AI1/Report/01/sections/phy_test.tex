\subsection{Tests of the Robot Behaviours}
In order to test the functionality of the behaviours implemented each can be tested individually.
The position controller used in the line following algorithm can be tested by letting the robot drive along a line and record the error of the line sensors.
The smaller it is able to hold the error, the better it is.
Furthermore the line following can be tested with and without the tomato can to check the response when the robot has a load.

To test the turning behaviours the robot can be told to drive in a square and if it is able to maintain the same square, the turning function works.
