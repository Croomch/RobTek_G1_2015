\subsection{SPI Module}
To communicate with the IMU a SPI module was made.
The module is made up of three phases.
One being the phase where the slave is told what is going to happen.
The second being the read or write phase where the FPGA either reads data from the IMU or sends data to the IMU.
Finally there is the wait state where there is no communication amongst the two units.

The SPI module was implemented as an 8 bit data transmitter and receiver.
It is however possible to read multiple bytes in succession from the IMU, it was however deemed unnecessary to use all 16 bit the current version of the segway.
