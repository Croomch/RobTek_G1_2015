In order to make a functional Segway controlled by the provided FPGA a simple two-wheel system for this must be constructed.
Two H-bridge drivers, one for each of the motors, is also required in order to have full control of the systems movement and a set of sensors are needed in order to control the system.
This is hence considered in this section, starting with the choice of motors and sensors and then followed by the H-bridge and Segway design.
