\section*{Project Description}

A segway is a two wheel system able to balance itself in a stable position. 
By unbalancing the system in one or the other direction, the segway is able to move back and forward.
In this project a scale model of a segway will be build.
The system should be able to stand by itself and recover when it is put out of balance.

The most basic segway system is composed by two motors, a gyroscope or accelerometer as inclination sensor and a controller.
In this project a FPGA board is going to be used as a controller to close the control loop.
%This system is equivalent to a inverse pendulum, this means it can be controlable with a PI controller.
To control the motor speed in both back and forward directions a H-bridge driver will be used.



%What we need:

%\begin{itemize}
%\item 2 motors
%\item accelerometer and gyroscope
%\item FPGA (we have)
%\item possibly ADC if analogue acc/gyro (we have)
%\item motor driver (should be able to build ourself)
%\end{itemize}
