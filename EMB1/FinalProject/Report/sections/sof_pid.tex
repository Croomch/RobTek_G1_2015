\subsection{PID Controller}

The PID module developed implements a PID controller using as a input a reference signal for the desired value of the accelerometer and the actual aceleration value as two logic vectors.

As all the operations into the PID are calculated using integers, this vectors are converted into integers before the operations, and reconverted into a logic vector again representing the value of the duty cycle needed in the motors and their direction.
This vector has now 9 bits, being the bits from 0 to 7 the ones representing the chosen duty cycle and the bit 8 a flag for the direction of the motors (positive or negative action needed means one or another motor direction).

Three different values can be set to modify the PID performance: a gain for each proportional, integral and diferential action.
