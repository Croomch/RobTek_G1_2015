Segways has in the past years had an increasing popularity and are now available in different sizes and shapes.
The most challenging part of a segway is its control.
The controller of a segway should be able to balance the segway, an unstable two wheel system and do so without loosing balance.

To build a segway a set of motors need to be selected.
These have to be controlled and for such a driver is needed.
A sensory system is needed to quantify the inclination of the segway and the direction of such.
On top of this a controller is needed to hold the segway stable over time.

The whole control of the segway will be constructed around an FPGA as the control unit.
An on board power supply will also be added to the system to regulate the voltage from the power source, regardless if it this comes from a battery or stationary power supply.
