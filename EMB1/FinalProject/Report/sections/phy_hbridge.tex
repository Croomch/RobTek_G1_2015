\subsection{Motor Control}
The motors chosen for this project were the two small geared DC motors\footnote{ \href{https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13258}{Motors}}.
In order to control them an H-bridge for both of the motors were constructed using the schematics in figure \ref{fig:hbridge}.

\end{figure}

A full H-bridge is required in order to control the Segways movement in both directions such that it is able to both move and recover from a fall when moving around.
Each motor is made with each their separate H-bridge in order to facilitate the rotation of the segway.
