\subsection{Power Supply}
In order to obtain an stable voltage in the FPGA module used in the case of using batteries as a power source for the system, a power supply has been built.
This circuit supplies a 5V voltage to the FPGA module, and it is this module the one in charge of supply 3.3V to the gyroscope/accelerometer and the bluetooth module.

To obtain this 5V supply from a higher voltage, an LM2574 regulator is used connecting it with the configuration shown in figure \ref{__}.

Although at the beginning this supply was chosen to drive the motors too, it was found that the power it can provide is not bug enough for the motors.
For this reason, the motors should have an independent power supply or been powered directly from the batteries in case of having a reasonable voltage for them, as some excess of voltage can be virtually pulled down using the PWM signal on the driver's gates.
