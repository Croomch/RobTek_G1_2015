\subsection{Conclusion}
A set of motors were chosen and for these a full H-bridge designed to be controlled by the output of the FPGA.
An IMU was also selected to use in order to control the inclination of the segway and keep it stable.
Furthermore a power supply was designed to convert the input voltage to the system into the required 5V range of the FPGA.

The set of components were then put together to form a segway with the main goal of distributing the weight evenly on the FPGA to  enhance its stability.
