\subsection{Data Filter}

The value in an accelerometer is often noisy, what can give some problems in case of having small movements of the device.
To solve this problem, the commonly used solution is to use the value given by a gyroscope it with the accelerometer lectures to obtain a more accurate result.
As this approach is complex and not really needed to obtain a simple control of the segway, a more simple solution has been selected.

The accelerometer has been filtered using a mean filter.
The filtering module calculates the mean of the last few readings from the accelerometer, giving as an output a 8 bit value.
This 8 bits represent the value of aceleration obtained, being 0 m/s$^{2}$ the value 127, all the values above it positive and all the values under 127 negatives.
This filter is also used as a converter from the value of acceleration given by the device into this new rank from -127 to 127.
