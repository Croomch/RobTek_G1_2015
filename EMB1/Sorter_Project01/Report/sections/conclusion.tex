A system was constructed using LEDs and a photodiode making it possible to detect the light intensity of the bricks when red, green and blue light is shined upon them.
An ADC was used to digitalize the data from the photodiode and send it to the FPGA.
Using thresholds, the color of the brick was then detected on the FPGA as either blue, red or green.
This information was then used to sort the bricks to the left or right depending on their color using a servo motor.

All the electronics are supplied by a powersupply converting a 15V supply into 5V, 6V and 12V.

It was found that this setup worked desirably, but with room for improvement.
The brick was capable of sorting ....
\todo[inline]{write about the tests}

This includes being able to amplify the signal from the photodiode to a range of 0 to 3.3V without saturating because of the amplifier going in saturation.
