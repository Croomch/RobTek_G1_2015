\subsection{Power Supply}
The power supply has been build to deliver three different voltage levels of 5V, 6V and 12V, ensuring a current of 1A, 1.5A and 1A respectively.

This circuit has been printed in a PCB that can be plugged directly into the breadboard to deliver the required voltage and current.
The schematics of such can be seen in figure \ref{fig:powersupply_schematics}.

\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}


The power supply is connected to a 15V power supply as a input voltage. 
To convert this 15V into 12V, 6V and 5V three different elements are used.
To ensure a 5V/1A supply with a $\pm 1.5\%$ voltage for the FPGA, an LM2574 regulator is used. 
For the 6V/1.5A and 12V/1A, the 7806 and 7812 regulators are used. 
As the efficiency of these regulators is not as good as the one of the LM2574 and they dissipate the excess of power by heating up, a heat-sink for these is required.

The 7806 and 7812 both have a working temperature of maximum $125^{\circ} C$.
In order to hold the temperature of the voltage regulators below this, a heat sink able to dissipate all the heat at the maximum supply rates should be used.

The total energy dissipated by the two regulators can be found by equation \ref{eq:powersupply_energy_dissipation}.

\begin{equation}
P = V_{7806} \cdot I_{7806} + V_{7812} \cdot I_{7812} = (15 - 6) \cdot 1.5 + (15 - 12) \cdot 1 = 16.5W
\label{eq:powersupply_energy_dissipation}
\end{equation}


Estimating the surrounding temperatures to be around $25^{\circ} C$, then the heat sink must keep the temperature below $100^{\circ} C$ rise when $21W$ is dissipated.
This results in a heat sink capable of rising less than $6 ^{\circ}K/W$ is needed to cool the two regulators.

With a $3^{\circ}K/W$ heating coefficient it should be capable of keeping the two regulators at $75^{\circ}C$ during operation with the full load and at a $25^{\circ}C$ ambient temperature.



To test the three power supplies, different loads was added to the outputs of the supplies to check if they meet the specified requirements.
The voltage supplied by the regulators was measured by an oscilloscope and the average recorded for the given load.
The results are seen in figure \ref{fig:voltagesupply}.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width = 0.9 \textwidth]{images/powersupply_output}
\caption{Voltage output of the voltage regulators with different loads.}
\label{fig:voltagesupply}
\end{figure}

As seen in figure \ref{fig:voltagesupply} then the power supplies supply a voltage slightly less than desired when exposed to the full load, but as this decreases the voltage reaches the desired voltage.
This might not be desirable, but it is deemed good enough for the project since the power supply rarely, if at all, will be used with full load.


Furthermore the efficiency of the 5V power supply was calculated.
This was done using equation \ref{eq:powersupply_efficiency}.

\begin{equation}
Efficiency = \frac{P_{out}}{P_{in}} = \frac{V_{out}^2 / R_{out}}{V_{in} \cdot I_{in}}
\label{eq:powersupply_efficiency}
\end{equation}

Where, in equation \ref{eq:powersupply_efficiency}, V is the voltage (V), R the load ($\Omega$) and I the current (A) for the circuit where \textit{in} is what was supplied by the 15V supply and \textit{out} the output of the regulator.


\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Load ($\Omega$) & Min Efficiency & Avg. Efficiency & Max Efficiency \\ \hline
5 & 0.7806 & 0.7996 & 0.8367 \\ \hline
7.5 & 0.7570 & 0.8095 & 0.8096 \\ \hline
15 & 0.7556 & 0.7640 & 0.8587 \\ \hline
33 & 0.644 & 0.6607 & 0.7318 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Efficiency of the 5V supply.}
\label{tab:voltageefficiency}
\end{table}

The efficiency was calculated considering that the input supply is stable and using the maximum, minimum and average output voltages measured with the oscilloscope.
It can be seen from table \ref{eq:powersupply_efficiency} that the efficiency of the regulator is capable of supplying the voltages at the project requirement of 80\%, for small loads.
As the load increases above $7.5\Omega$ the efficiency decreases considerably.
This is however expectable since the regulator used specifies that the efficiency is highest when driving a load with 0.5A at 5V and then only is specified to achieve the 80\%.
