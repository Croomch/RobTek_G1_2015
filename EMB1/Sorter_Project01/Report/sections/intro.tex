\section{Introduction}

This project describes the creation of an autonomous brick sorter to sort red, green and blue Lego bricks into separate directions.
This is to be done using a slide to which there is attached a servo motor to control whether the brick is going to the left or right.
Furthermore this project considers the design of the circuits used for power supplies and   color detecting circuit.

For the control of the brick sorter a FPGA is used to control the system.
The project also requires the use of uTosNet to communicate with a computer.

This report is structured such that it first describes the hardware and schematics used.
Thereafter the program run on the FPGA is considered and finally a test of the system is conducted and a conclusion on the whole project is drawn.



%This way, the project can be easily divided in 6 different blocks,

%\begin{itemize}
%\item Power supply
%\item Light sensor.
%\item LED Control.
%\item Servo motor.
%\item PC communication.
%\item VHDL design.
%\end{itemize}
