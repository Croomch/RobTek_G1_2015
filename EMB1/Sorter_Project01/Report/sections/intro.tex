To sort bricks in function of their color two things are needed. First, a color detector is needed to measure the color of the brick, and a servo motor is used to sort them into 2 diferent stacks.

All the system is controlled with the Spartan 3 Experimentation board.

This board is the one in charge of the control of all the system, comunicating with an ADC that converts the analog signal of the light sensor into a digital signal, a servo motor to sort the different bricks, all the LEDs' drivers and the PC interface.

A power supply to set 12, 6 and 5V is needed in order to power each part of the system.

This way, the project can be easily divided in 6 different blocks,

\begin{itemize}
\item [-] Power supply
\item [-] LED controller.
\item [-] Light sensor.
\item [-] Servo motor.
\item [-] PC communication.
\item [-] VHDL design.
\end{itemize}
