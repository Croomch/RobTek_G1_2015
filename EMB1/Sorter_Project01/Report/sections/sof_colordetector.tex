\subsection{Color Detector}
The color detector is responsible for figuring out which, if any, brick color passes by the sensor.
It does this by using both input from the ADC Communication and by controlling the three different colors of LEDs.

The color detector component is designed as the state machine in figure \ref{fig:colordetector_fsm}.

\node[state,name=green,minimum width=1.8cm] at (c.0)   {Green}; 
\node[state,name=blue,minimum width=1.8cm] at (c.-90)   {Blue};

\end{tikzpicture}

\label{fig:colordetector_fsm}
\end{figure}

As seen on figure \ref{fig:colordetector_fsm} the state machine starts in \textit{Decide} from there it cycles around from state to state recording the intensity values for the three different colors.
Whenever it reaches state \textit{Decide}, it compares the three intensities with its thresholds to decide which brick color passed.
