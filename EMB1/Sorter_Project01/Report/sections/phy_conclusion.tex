\subsection{Conclusion}
A functional power supply was designed to convert the supplied 15V supply into a 5V, 6V and 12V supply using two linear voltage regulators and a switching voltage regulator.
Furthermore a cooling plate was dimensioned to be capable of cooling the two linear voltage regulators in their working temperature range in worst case scenarios.
The voltage supplies where also tested with load and it was found that they supplied the needed voltage, but that the 5V regulator was not capable of holding the voltage above 5V when the load was close to the maximum requirements.

A driver for the three different colors of LEDs was designed using a MOSFET transistor.
The current limiting resistors for the LEDs where designed according to the response of the photodiode when exposed to the three different brick colors.

The photodiods signal was amplified using an amplifier and the signal routed to the ADC such that the FPGA is capable of getting the color intensity values.
