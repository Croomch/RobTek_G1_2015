\subsection{Servo Motor}
The servo motor is controlled by giving it a command to which of three positions it has to go.
The three positions are left, right and center.
The specific value to which it moves is made adjustable from the computer by setting a 9 bit signal for each of the three positions.
This generates a timing between 0 and 2ms, but the values are set manually to match the slider setup.
