\subsection{AD-Converter Communication}
The ADC communicates using SPI.
This is hence implemented in the module.
Since the ADC only allows up to 3.6MHz communication frequency, then the clock is scaled down to 3.57MHz.
The FPGA is then requesting the data from the ADC continuously and whenever a whole message is received, it is send out into the FPGA and a signal is pulsed to notify the color detector of the new message.
