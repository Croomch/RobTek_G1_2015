To sort bricks depending on their color two things are needed. 
First, a color detector is needed to measure the color of the brick, and a servo motor is used to sort them into two different stacks.

The whole system is controlled with the Spartan 3 Experimentation board.
This board is the one in charge of the control of all the system, communicating with an ADC that converts the analogue signal of the light sensor into a digital signal, a servo motor to sort the different bricks, all the LED drivers and the PC interface.

Furthermore a power supply to supply 12V, 6V and 5V is needed in order to power each part of the system.
The circuits used in the project are hence described in this section and they are tested accordingly.
